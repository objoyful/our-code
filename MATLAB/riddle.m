function solution = riddle()
    % Finds the correct number of marbles according to the riddle below. 
    % The solution is reached when every marble count is a positive integer. Outputs the first soultion. 
    % Also creates three pie charts of the first three solutions.
    % Riddle:
    % The number of red marbles (R) is unknown
    % The number of yellow marbles (Y) is (4R â€“ 4) / 5
    % The number of green marbles (G) is (2R + Y + 9) / 3
    % The number of blue marbles (B) is (3G + 2Y + 7) / 5
    % The number of purple marbles (P) is (R + Y + G + B - 79) / 4
    % solution = riddle()
    % Outputs:
    %   solution = output array of the solution (red, yellow, green, blue, purple marbles)

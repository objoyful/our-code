The Abacus (which appeared in the sixteenth century) was the first calculator. In the middle of the seventeenth century Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician, built and sold gear-driven mechanical machines which performed whole number addition and subtraction.  (Yes, the language Pascal is named for him.)
Later in the seventeenth century a German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz built the first mechanical device designed to do all four whole number operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  The state of mechanical gears and levers at that time was such that the Leibniz machine was not very reliable.
